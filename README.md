## Quick simple Portfolio project

I've always wanted to have a specific place to showcase whatever projects I'm most proud of, and this finally happened!
Built it using Create React App (CRA). The dependencies are shown in the package.json in case you want to run the project locally, which you can do by running
**npm start** .
You will also be able to check the live, deployed site on the link to the right soon!

The single page design was provided by the free, open-source course I've been a part of for some time called The Odin Project, and I just tried to recreate it and add a bit of my own flavor to it.
